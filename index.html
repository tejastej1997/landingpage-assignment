                Venkateswara literally means, "Lord of Venkata".
                The word is a combination of the words Venkata (the name of a hill in Andhra Pradesh) 
                and isvara ("Lord").According to the Brahmanda and Bhavishyottara Puranas, 
                the word "Venkata" means "destroyer of sins", deriving from the Sanskrit words vem (sins) and 
                kata (power of immunity).
                It is also said that 'Venkata' is a combination of two words: 'ven' (keeps away) and 'kata'
                (troubles). Venkata means he 'who keeps away troubles' or 'who takes away problems' or 
                such terms in a similar context.
